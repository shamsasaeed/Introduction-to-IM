#  Flashing Bugs!

## Inspiration 

We got inspired by a very addicting childhood game we both loved to play (we can't remember the name). In the game there were a bunch of beavers popping up in the screen where the player had to hit them to get a point. We thought that it would be really cool to try and re-create this but in real life format, which we got really excited about. We switched it up a bit by deciding to create  insects using the LEDs instead of beavers and using force sensors to destroy these insects instead of hitting them, and of course getting a point when destroying the bugs/insects on time.

## How Arduino And P5 Are Connected

In the Arduino, we have set up the game on the board and this will include five LEDs and five force sensors, resistors, and a button to start the game. For the Arduino code, we coded that the game would start when the button gets pressed on, the duration and blinking of the LED lights, and the points dispalying 0 when teh force isn't touched, and displaying 1 when the force sesnor is touched while the LED light is on.

## Summary concept of the Game:

For the game, the player has to press the button for the game to begin. When the button is pressed, the LED lights will start blinking. The player would then have to touch the force sensors on time where the LED is turned on, and when the player has done so, he or she will have a point.

## A challenging concept we couldn't cover:


## Some important contributers we used in our Arduino board and both codes:

- LEDs, Button, Force Sensors, Resistors, Wires.
- If Statements, Loops

## Coding proccess:

Even though putting up the circuit in the Arduino board took a long while, the coding process we would say has been the hardest part in this project. The first part of the Arduino coding of making the LEDs flash, the button working, and the force having a response had its challenges but they were easy to overcome. But, once we had our circuit working we started working with the rest of the Arduino code that we had to do to link it to P5, this was the most part we struggled with. The merging of sending Arduino to P5 has been a bit tricky for the both of us, but while researching, and testing the codes we mananged to make it work by also going through Github with the resources as well as going through old p5 and Arduino codes where we found bits and pieces of extra help from.

## Hardships during coding process:

We have faced many hardships during the coding process. The first issue was that we had countless errors that said that the port was not connected to the Arduino which we had to adjust multiple times. 

# Conclusion:

In conclusion, me and my partner would have never dreamed of creating something like this on our own. The building, the soldering, the coding, the entire process was a big challenge that we overcame. Even though we went through many confusions, errors, and struggles, we managed to get beyond them all and create a beautiful output that was worked very hard on.
