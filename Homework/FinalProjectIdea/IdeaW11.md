# FINAL PROJECT IDEA

For my final project, I've been thinking og a way to combine arduino and p5 in a fun and creative way. This will take a bit of time to finally settle on a finally idea, since I would like to talk to my group first and decide on something we would both like to do, maybe merge both ideas together to get a unique and challenging output that would really stand out. I've been trying to think about some stuff in the weekend and have come up with a few ideas.

My first idea revolves around creating a real life game. In the game, the user has to walk past a series of blocks. If the user steps on the right blocks the light bulb would turn green and a happy sound would appear. If the user steps on the wrong block for the first three times then a yellow bulb would appear with a warning sound. If the user steps on the fourth wrong block then the bulb will turn red and a lose sound would appear where then the user has to start over again. If the user crosses the path safely then the bulb would blink green five times and a victory sound would appear.

My second idea revolves around using the screen. The user would interact with the camera and try to catch falling stars. Each time a players catches a start witt their hand then a yellow bulb would light up indicating their catch. The user can also change the color of the stars by clicking on a button to make the game more interactive and fun, it would be kind of like a customizable choice a user would have but I haven't really decided on that yet.

These ideas are not final, but they are some possible ideas I could work on, but I wouldn't make it official yet since I might come up with something better.
