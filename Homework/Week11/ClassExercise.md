# Class Exercises - 1-3

## The Exercises

The first exercise included making something that uses only one sensor on arduino and makes the ellipse in p5 move on the horizontal axis, in the middle of the screen, and nothing on arduino is controlled by p5. I did the first exercise in class with a partner, Dilnaz. I was a bit nervous because I wasn't very comfortable with the merge of p5 and arduino. We first started to write the code into the arduino. Then we activated the p5 app and website since if we first activated the p5 app then tried to uplaod the arduino code an error would occur and we didn't want that to happen. We then typed the p5 website code by using the code from the p5 app then adding to it. We made sure to add the usbmodem number since each person has different number. We also made sure to add the serial server in the html on the p5 website since if we didn't an error would occur, and we were trying to avoid that. Then we started to work with the arduino board which was kind of the fun part. First, we plotted the one potentiometer sensor to test if the numbers printed on the p5, after testing and sure it worked we added another potentiometer sensor so then we had two sensors on the board. We created the ellipse on the code and tested it out with the sensors, and it worked! It was so cool to move the ellipse horizontally and vertically with the sensors, it was quite a great experience.The second exercise included making something that controls the LED brightness from p5. With this second exercise, I also worked with my partner Dilaz. I was a bit more comfortable with the merge of arduino and p5 after the first example. With the second example, we kept the code and everything that with in the arduino board, we just added a LED with the wires and a resistor. We also added on the code in the p5 and in the arduino code for the LED to turn on/off.

For the third exercise, we had to do it at home with a partner. I didn't have a partner when we worked the professor told us to work on this later on, so I did it by myself, with a but of help from a classmate. In the beginning, it was very useful that the professor has provided us with a sample code on p5. that we had to add on. I twisted the code a bit to get the desired outcome. Then, for the arduino board I didn't have to change anything really because I already saved the wires with the LED, and the two potentiometer sensors from last class which saved me a lot of time and tiny errors I would've gotten which I was happy about. I then went in with the Arduino code and set up the LED input and the sensor Input and put up an If else statement. After all these steps, I tested it out, and it worked! It was so cool to see the LED light up each time the ball bounced. It was also cool to use the potentiometer sensor to shift the ball on the direction I wanted as the ball was landing from above. It didn't work on the first try however, this is because in the arduino code I forgot the print statement which I didn't realize was important until then when I realized, I added it, and it worked after I fixed it.

## Statement

To conclude, I really enjoyed these mini class exercises, it really helped me to practice my coding skills and in hardware, especially with arduino and p5 merged together, after each exercise it became easier and easier to work with the both of them. But of course, with each exercise I did face some difficulties that I managed to overcome with some help from my partner and my classmate, and of course, my professor. Learning from my own mistakes helped me to make sure I got what I did wrong so i would not repeat it in the future, this made it a process of learning and advancing from what I started with.
