## Digital and Analog Switch - Blinking

# DIGITAL 

For my digital switch I decided to use the morse code using a [ youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mLytyKEU5Q). It was really fun to read a signal when the yellow button is pressed. For the signal I make it create a 'hello' signal and it looked really cool, I was so happy when it finally worked. A difficulty I have faced would be attaching the wires since I couldn't seem to be able to turn on the light of the bulb, which was very frustrating, but once I fixed the issue and the led worked I was very proud of myself since it did really take a very long time. It turned out I got mixed up between the positive and negative sides. To avoid this issue and make it easier for myself, I started testing it out on tinkercad first. The coding part was not so difficult for me when using the digital switch, since I had some external help with the morse code and the example we did in class with the code on the arduino and breadboard on digital Input which made me understand and write out the code much more easily, and I think this helped me to develop my coding skills more accurately. Turning a basic code into something that looked very creative and fun was cool and I cannot wait to do more of this in the future.

# ANALOG

For my analog switch, I decided to stick to the theme of blinking and use a red light bulb to show a sign of signaling. For this I used the photoresistor with the example of the arduino analog Input posted on github. I modified the code by adding the blinking effect to make it look creative with a flash warning kind of effect. For the analog switch I started doing the code and attachment of the wires in tinkercad, this saved a lot of time for me since when I started putting the circuit together, I didn't get any error and the light bulb worked perfectly. I found it difficult to make the blinking effect in the coding in the beginning because it was not blinking as I wanted to, but with a few adjustments, I managed to create the blinking that I wanted. The analog was a bit easier for me because I took a lot of time on the digital that I feel like the practice gave me the skills to compleet the analog at a easier and faster rate.
