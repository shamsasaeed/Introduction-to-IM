# Instrument - Switch/Sensor

## IDEA 

We spent quite some time thinking about the instrument we wanted to work with. First, we started brainstorming some ideas by playing around with Tinkercad to see what we could do before working with the arduino code and board. The idea came up when we decided to use a speaker with the ultrasound sensor where the sound would change based on the distance. We researched about the idea we wanted and came across a [Youtube video](https://youtube.com/shorts/-wdzY0l-vOg?feature=share) that demonstrated using a speaker, an ultrasound sensor, as well as a force sensor. We loved the idea and wanted to work with that immediately because of idea that we could control the sound from the unltrasound sensor. The force sensor was used to stop the ultrasound which we should was great because the user could control how the music stops and starts, and also create a pattern to show the artistic side of this instrument. We played around with a code for a while by changing the frequencies until we found the right ones we thought sounded the best. The fequencies started by increasing then decreasing again which was fun to play around with. When we finished putting the code in Tinkercad and liked what was happening in the circuit, we started working with the arduino board, it took quite some time to get all the wires in the right places with the speaker, force sensor, ultrasound sensor, and later on a button that we added.

## PROGRESS

When we had two sensors put into the adruino and had a musical instrument playing, we needed to create a switch. For the switch, we wanted to use one to make the music start and stop. This is because when we palyed the code the music would automatically start, and it made it quite annoying and caused a sound when we didn't wanted to play. The only way we could stop the sound was by holding down the force sensor which we didn't like because we wanted the force sensor to be a way a user could play around with after the music starts. So for the switch we wanted it to open and close the sound of the ultrasound sensor playing from the speaker. We decided to use a button because it is the easiest to use and it shows a clear statement as an on and off switch. When the button is not clicked, the instrument would not start, when the button is clicked on and the user puts their hand in front of the ultrasound sensor the music would play while moving their hand to change the sound through the different frequncies from the distance. If the user would like to use the force sensor then ethey would also hold that to top the music for ashort period of time or to create a pattern.

## STRUGGLES

We have faced quite a few difficulties when craeting this musical instrument. For the arduino board, the sensors weren't working in the beginning which later we noticed was because we sttached the wrong wires in the wrong places and had to changed that. But, something that is very confusing was that, so we do know that black wires go to black ground (-) and the red wires go on the red (+), when we attached random wires to work, to test the instrument it worked. But, when we tried to put the black and red wires on teh right places, the instrument wouldn't work which was very wierd. We want to point this out because we know were to put the wires but for this it doesn't work and we were scared the instrument will not work if we kept moving the wires after we have spent a lot of time connecting the wires in the right places and making the instrument work, but for next time, we will make sure to put the black and red wires in the right places. A struggle we faced in the coding part would be the adding ofthe button since we first did not know how to write the correct code for it, but with some testing and using different codes we then figured it out and were so proud.

# Statement

Overall, even though it took a lot of time and effort into this instrument it was definitely worth it. We have learned so much from playing around with the arduino and the experience was great. We got through the struggles and obstacles we have faced by working with each other and learning from our mistakes. With teamwork, we have managed to create an instrument by coming up with an idea, testing it out, and fixing the issues we have faced throughout our time together. It was to experience creating an instument that has music with only using coding and a board from the arduino.
