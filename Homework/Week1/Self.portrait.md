# Self Portrait
This is my homework, and I have used:
* shapes
* colors
* fill

It was my first time using code in p5.js but I have very proud of what I have created. I started off with the shape shape because I needed to create a base before adding the features which included eyes, nose, mouth, and hair. I used colors that matched myself and it was fun to pick out the shade that I thought had the most resemblence.
