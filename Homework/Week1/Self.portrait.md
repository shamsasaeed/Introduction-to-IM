# Self Portrait
This is my homework, and I have used:
* shapes
* colors
* fill

It was my first time using coding in the website p5.js, but I am very proud of what I have created. I started off with the face shape because I needed to create a base before adding the features. This included the eyes, nose, mouth, and hair. I used colors that matched myself and it was very fun to pick out the shade which I thought had the most resemblence. I didn't face much difficulty during my coding process however the coding did take a long time since I tried to get the right values for the code to be in the right area on the coding space, but in the end I got it all figured out!
