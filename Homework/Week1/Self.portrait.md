# Self Portrait
This is my homework, and I have used:
* shapes
* colors
* fill

It was my first time using coding in the website p5.js, but I am very proud of what I have created. I started off with the face shape because I needed to create a base before adding the features. This included the eyes, nose, mouth, and hair. I used colors that matched myself and it was very fun to pick out the shade which I thought had the most resemblence.
