## My work of art using loops

**Introduction**

For my art, I decided to create a place I love, the beach. I always loved the sound of the waves, the texture of the sand, and the splash
of the water coming on the sand. This was a very fun piece, however it did take quite a while. This is because I had to work with a few 
loops that needed several adjustments until I got the final pattern I wanted, and I am so happy with the result!

The link above shows the live version of my code, you can see the waves splashing into the shore and the white color which represents the waves.
