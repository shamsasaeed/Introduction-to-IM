## Art in Text

The process of creating this art work has been a fun journey, with planning, trying, making mistakes, and trying again. From shapes to colors to effects I had to try, none of it has given be any disappointment. The beautiful design is making me really happy that I come this far with this piece of live coding. It was a bit challenging for me to perfect the code as I tried to make it look as complex as I hoped it would appear to be. It was trickier for me to work with text than objects because of the advancements I wanted to add. Overall, I went through some hardships, but the final output gave me a great result that I really love and am proud of. This piece wasn't really inspired by anything, but I just wanted to be creative and try something new while playing around with coding (and trying to avoid errors on the process).
