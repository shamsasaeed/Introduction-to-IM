## Art in Text


The overal concept of my art work is based on my day dreaming. I zone out pretty quickly when I am not focused on my surroundings. Thos code I came up with describes where I envision myself to be when I zone out. I'm not present on Earth. I'm in space, floating in a rocket, and watching the shooting stars pass by as I admire each one.

Some problems that I ran into while doing my code was using the arrays appropraitly, I had to adjust my code several times to finally see no error. The mistakes I made are pretty minimal, however it definitely took some time for me to fix all of them.
