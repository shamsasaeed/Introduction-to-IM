## Game Progression

For my game, I wanted to make a ghost game, where the player has to click as many ghosts as she or he can until the mustic stops playing, where the music is 2 minutues and 30 seconds long. I had to first find a background, where I found the most interesting one. Then I tried to choose a music for the background which took quite a while since I really wanted to find a sound that suited the game I wanted to make, which required a tune that matched the tension in the game. Then, I went ahead and put the ghosts, stars, and text but I had difficulties with these three. I don't know why but the ghosts were not appearing for me on the screen. Another thing is that the stars and text are appearing only after I click which I got confused about. Lastly, the text is not at the top like I wanted. I don't have time to figure out how to fix my mistakes however hopefully I would soon.

After further working on the code, I have managed to fix my mistakes, however the only issue I am still facing is the ghosts, which are still not appearing for me. Also added additional comments for more clarification.
