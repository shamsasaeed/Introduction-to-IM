## Unusual Switch

I spent a very long thinking about what switch I wanted to do, however, for a while nothing crossed my mind. I was looking for something creative and fun, and not easy or straight forward. After thinking for a little too long, I sat next to my pet bird 'sky' to think. I was staring at its metal cup in the cage that she never used, then suddenly, an idea clicked. I decided to cut up some foil, toss them in the bowl. Then when I put the two wires, I started to shake the cup, and when I did, the lights turned on, it was amazing! The shaking gave a nice sound and it was really fun as I tried to shake it up as it made me want to keep the light on as long as I could. Since this assignemnt asked for no hands, I then tried to shake up the cup with my feet, which was much more difficult than I had thought it would be, but it was still fun to try. Setting up the wires was not difficult since we had already practiced doing that in class togetehr and the demonstration was very clear. A difficulty I have faced would be keeping the light on since I had to really shake well in order for it to shine brightly, especially when I was using my feet. I have attached the video below which demonstrates the hands and without hands performances. I really enjoyed this interactive homework, even though it took some time and thinking, it was really fun in the end.
